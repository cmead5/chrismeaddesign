    <h1>The Barn</h1>
    <h2>Elevating a Local Staple with Personality and Purpose</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>In 2023, The Barn—an iconic breakfast and lunch spot housed in a literal barn in Crestwood—came under new ownership. Known for its upscale farm-fresh offerings and rustic charm, the new owner sought to preserve its identity while modernizing the brand to expand its reach and support future growth.</p>

    <h3>Role</h3>
    <p>As Creative Director, I collaborated directly with the owner to define a phased rebranding strategy. With a limited budget, we prioritized high-impact elements and infused the refreshed brand with the owner’s humor, progressive culinary vision, and desire to connect with a broader audience.</p>

    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <p>The rebrand was intentionally incremental, beginning with a refined visual identity:
A refreshed logo with bolder, more modern typography while maintaining rustic character
Print and takeout menus designed for easy updates
Door signage with scannable QR codes to drive traffic and promote reservations
Merchandise including humorous t-shirt designs and branded campfire mugs (a customer favorite)
A strategy to weave the interior décor and community connection into the brand voice</p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>The rebrand reinvigorated the restaurant’s identity while honoring its roots. Menu and merchandise updates have driven strong engagement, and customer buzz around the mugs and apparel continues to grow. Most importantly, the creative partnership continues to evolve as new ideas—and new dishes—keep coming.</p>

    <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
    <p>Helping a beloved neighborhood spot grow without losing its soul is a rare privilege. This project brought together strategy, storytelling, and a whole lot of laughter. Contributing to a business that’s deeply embedded in the community—and getting to experiment with humor along the way—made this one of the most rewarding creative partnerships I’ve had.</p>
