      <h1>InCLUEsive Trucking</h1>
      <p><strong>A bold brand launch for a minority-owned trucking startup</strong></p>

      <!-- ============================= -->
      <!--          OVERVIEW            -->
      <!-- ============================= -->
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        InCLUEsive Trucking is a minority-owned small parcel delivery business started from scratch by Ric DeClue. From the name itself, he and his wife sought to build something inclusive, intentional, and distinctly different—beginning with a vision, not just a vehicle.
      </p>

      <!-- ============================= -->
      <!--            ROLE              -->
      <!-- ============================= -->
      <h2>Role</h2>
      <p>
        As Creative Director, I met with Ric early in the naming and branding phase. Concerned the name might be misread as a typo, I knew the visual identity needed to feel smart, deliberate, and confident. I created a strong, intentional logo and helped articulate Ric’s distinct vision with the tagline: <em>Setting New Expectations</em>—a phrase that became the heartbeat of the brand. Listening closely, staying mindful of the nuance, and building with empathy helped ensure the brand felt not just polished, but deeply personal.
      </p>

      <!-- ============================= -->
      <!--          APPROACH            -->
      <!-- ============================= -->
      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>
        We used the tagline as a guiding principle. From business cards to truck graphics, every piece of collateral was crafted to feel polished and professional—regardless of the startup budget. By giving the brand a corporate-quality presence, we opened doors and helped Ric stand out from day one.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Brand identity and logo design</li>
        <li>Business cards, bill of lading, price sheets</li>
        <li>Vehicle magnets and truck graphics</li>
        <li>Unified brand voice built around a single promise</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- ============================= -->
      <!--           OUTCOME            -->
      <!-- ============================= -->
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        Ric now has a brand that opens conversations and reinforces his credibility. What began as an idea quickly took shape into a recognizable, trustworthy presence in the market—one that reflects both his grit and his professionalism.
      </p>

      <!-- ============================= -->
      <!--        WHY IT MATTERS        -->
      <!-- ============================= -->
      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        This wasn’t just another project—it was a relationship. Helping someone turn a dream into momentum is deeply fulfilling. Ric trusted me to help shape his business, and in the process, we built something far more valuable than just a brand: we built trust.
