    <h1>InCLUEsive Trucking</h1>
    <h2>A bold brand launch for a minority-owned trucking startup</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>InCLUEsive Trucking is a minority-owned small parcel delivery business started from scratch by Ric DeClue. From the name itself, he and his wife sought to build something inclusive, intentional, and distinctly different—beginning with a vision, not just a vehicle.</p>

    <h3>Role</h3>
    <p>As Creative Director, I met with Ric early in the naming and branding phase. Concerned the name might be misread as a typo, I knew the visual identity needed to feel smart, deliberate, and confident. I created a strong, intentional logo and helped articulate Ric’s distinct vision with the tagline: <em>Setting New Expectations</em>—a phrase that became the heartbeat of the brand. Listening closely, staying mindful of the nuance, and building with empathy helped ensure the brand felt not just polished, but deeply personal.</p>

    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <p>We used the tagline as a guiding principle. From business cards to truck graphics, every piece of collateral was crafted to feel polished and professional—regardless of the startup budget. By giving the brand a corporate-quality presence, we opened doors and helped Ric stand out from day one.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Brand identity and logo design</li>
      <li>Business cards, bill of lading, price sheets</li>
      <li>Vehicle magnets and truck graphics</li>
      <li>Unified brand voice built around a single promise</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>Ric now has a brand that opens conversations and reinforces his credibility. What began as an idea quickly took shape into a recognizable, trustworthy presence in the market—one that reflects both his grit and his professionalism.</p>

    <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
    <p>This wasn’t just another project—it was a relationship. Helping someone turn a dream into momentum is deeply fulfilling. Ric trusted me to help shape his business, and in the process, we built something far more valuable than just a brand: we built trust.</p>
