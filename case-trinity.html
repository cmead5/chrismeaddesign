    <h1>Trinity Retail</h1>
    <h2>National Rebrand for Trinity Health Cafes & Retail</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Trinity Health Ministries was transitioning its retail and café spaces from third-party vendors to an internal model across dozens of hospitals. This shift required a comprehensive brand system that could scale with consistency—while still offering individual locations room for distinction.</p>

    <h3>Role</h3>
    <p>As Creative Director and lead designer, I was responsible for the design and rollout of the flagship hospital locations and led the creative process for all others. I also oversaw the UX and visual design of the internal ordering platform and on-demand signage tools.</p>

    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <p>We developed a complete support system for hospital-based retail and café teams. This included:
 <ul>
  <li>Modular collateral: banners, menus, posters, wall clings, stickers, packaging, and more</li>
<li>Visual variations for different café concepts under the Trinity umbrella</li>
<li>A custom B2B ordering site with user-friendly navigation and asset previews</li>
<li>A dynamic digital signage system, enabling real-time menu updates across multiple display types</li>
</ul>
</p>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>This rebrand brought consistency, clarity, and professionalism to each location, helping Trinity Health create a unified brand presence nationwide. The digital signage system, which I personally designed, sees hundreds of uses each week—something I continue to track with pride. Being trusted with the flagship locations and seeing my work implemented across ministries around the country was both humbling and deeply meaningful.</p>

    <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
    <p>From a creative standpoint, to have been able to have had such an impact on such an organization is humbling, but also empowering. There is nothing I cannot accomplish.</p>
